<h1> Transpiler.And.Similar.List </h1>

List Of Transpilers, TransCompilers, Decompilers, etc [source-code to source-code converter][1], &amp; similar &amp; related tools/apps.  
  
( History : I created a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64180191/) in StackOverflow(SO), where i have initially asked Which transpiler can convert `"Go"` source-code into `"C"` source-code, and then i had to change question & ask : Which transpiler (out of four specific transpiler) can convert from `Go` to `C/C++` and can still keep (almost all) high-level algorithms & structures used in source-code , fairly accurately same/intact in output source-code . And this project/data borned from that research, so later when StackOverflow's `"PRO-GOOGLE"` & `"PRO-GO"` do-evil mods ganged-up on my Quesiton+Answer & deleted it (vote to undelete [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/recently-deleted-questions/3553808)) , i had to publish from this github project, & improve it here. )

# TRANSPILE&#8239;:
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>CPL</b>&#160;=&#160;Computer&#160;Programming&#160;Language &#124; <b>f.e.</b> = for-example &#124; <b>i.e.</b> = in-example &#124; <b>e.g.</b> = example-goes-to.  

Which TRANSPILER Can Convert/**[Transpile][1]**/Transcompile/Transform Input Source-Code (for-example: `"Go"` or Any/✱ other CPL) Into (A Different Language) Output Source-Code (for-example: `"C"` or Any/✱ other CPL) <b>?</b>  

Which TRANSPILER Can Keep High-Level Algorithms / Structures Used In Input Source-Code (f.e: `"Go"` or Any/✱ other CPL) Fairly Accurately Intact/Same After Conversion Into A Different Language Based Generated / Output / Destination / Target Source-Code (f.e: `"C"` or Any/✱ other CPL), As Much As Possible <b>?</b>  
<br />

( abbreviations : `lang` = language &#124; `C++` = `Cpp` = `C-plus-plus` &#124; `Go` = `Golang` )  

TRANSPILE : source-code to source-code conversion , where high-level structures, algorithms, etc (of input code) are usually kept same or accurate during conversion process (in output code) . Sometime extra codes are needed in output code, to function same as input code.  
<br />
<br />

<h4>( YOU MAY GOTO <a href="List/">LIST OF ALL TRANSPILERS</a> DIRECTLY FROM <a href="List/">HERE</a> )</h4>
<br />
<br />

# SOURCE-CODE&#8239; EXAMPLES&#8239;:
For example, when input code (`"Go"` language code) contains:
```Go
// "Go" based source-code:
var n int
type Node struct {
    left, right *Node
    data    interface{}
}

func twice(f func(int) int, v int) int {
    return f(f(v))
}

func main() {
    f := func(v int) int {
        return v + 3
    }
    twice(f, 7) // returns 13
}
```

Then, this `"Go"`-to-`"C"` conversion/transpilation<sup>[1][2]</sup> process need to convert & generate/output below `"C"` language code:
```C
// Converted "C"-lang based source-code
#include <stdio.h>

typedef int (*int_func_int) (int);

int n;
struct Node {
    struct Node *left, *right;
    void    *data;
};

int add3(int x) {
    return x + 3;
}

int twice(int_func_int f, int v) {
    return f(f(v));
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", twice(add3, 7));
    return 0;
}
```

When `"Go"`-to-`"C++"` (`C++14`) transpilation is done, then output should be:
```C++
// Converted "C++"(C++14)-lang based source-code
#include <iostream>

int n;
struct Node {
    struct Node *left, *right;
    void    *data;
};  

auto twice = [](auto f, int v)
{
    return f(f(v));
};

auto f = [](int i)
{
    return i + 3;
};

int main()
{
    std::cout << twice(f, 7) << std::endl;
}
```

When `"Go"`-to-`"C++"` (`C++11`) transpilation is done, then output should be:
```C++
// Converted "C++"(C++11)-lang based source-code
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int n;
struct Node {
    struct Node *left, *right;
    void    *data;
};  

auto twice = [](const std::function<int(int)>& f, int v)
{
    return f(f(v));
};

auto f = [](int i)
{
    return i + 3;
};

int main()
{
    std::cout << twice(f, 7) << std::endl;
}
```
An actual EXAMPLE of "C"-to-"Go" CODE is shown [here][3] <sup>[2][4], [3][5]</sup>, but we want opposite of "C"-to-"Go" : so we want "Go"-to-"C" (go-to-c / go2c).  
<br />
<br />

# FEW&#160; POINTS&#8239;:
`•` Let us assume, you're more familiar with `"C"` & `"C++"` more, than `"Go"`.  
`•` In computer programming language, let us assume, `C`/`C++`/`Assembly` are your native computer language (these you have learned in School/University, & then practiced).  
`•` So it should be okay to convert `non-C` & `non-C++` language `"Go"` aka: `"Golang"` , into `"C"` or `"C++"`, to understand better.  
`•` Learning a second computer language (for example: `"Go"`) (or lets say: French) & hoping to become expert within 7-days or so like your native computer language (`"C"` or `"C++"`) (or lets say: English) , is not only a plain wrong expectation , if any fool suggested such then that i consider a wrong advice , because this will NOT take you to a LEVEL where you can begin to contribute in real open-source projects . But one of the right advice can be this : Start to learn+practice the second computer language in parallel (in a different, easy & forked project), as it will take long time & effort to reach expert level in that second computer language.  
`•` So, we do not want to keep any input (`"Go"`) source-code remaining in output (`C/C++`) source-code . ( But some `Assembly` is fine in output if you're okay with `Assembly` language ) . And also be aware of that ['Go' Has Problems](https://github.com/ksimka/go-is-not-good) <sup>[2][6], [3][7], [4][8]</sup> , [Security Vulnerabilities of 'Golang'][9] <sup>[2][10], [3][11], [4][12], [5][13]</sup>, etc are just few reasons to move away from `"Go"`, and use other language . You have full freedom & right to choose what you want to do.  
`•` Let us assume, Necessary Features or Functionality that i or you need to add, those are developed & optimized for `C/C++`, not-available in `"Go"`.  
`•` Programs that i or you want to TRANSPILE/CONVERT from `Go-to-C` or from `Go-to-C++`, that type of programs should be developed with `C/C++`, as that type of programs work better with `C`, and even more better with `C++`.  
`•` Recreating complex & large software/systems with years of development from scratch with another (second) computer language , is not-only hard , that is also not-suggested<sup>[1][14]</sup> (not-adviced) , So transcompilation steps are helpful to give a head-start by converting easier source-code . Transcompilation process always requires human developer based manual code conversion, as none of the Transpilers are perfect or supports ALL aspects of source/input language or different programming styles, codes, libraries, etc that are used in real practical projects/languages . Small project(s) or new project can be built from scratch, and even by using a second computer language.  
`•` If source code is from open-source project , then Human/manual and/or automated transpilation of output source-code should also be released as open-source , same as input source-code . In that way, another group of developers skilled at output language (`C/C++`) can also participate in open-source development, to help all users & people.

# SOLUTIONS&#160; FOR&#160; 'Go'-TO-'C'&#8239;:
Currently, i SPECIFICALLY have these solutions/choices to use:  
`•` Solution A or #1 : "[go2cs][15]", "[CSharp.lua][16]", "[lua2c][17]".  
`•` Solution B or #2 : "[go2cs][15]", "[Blazor][18]", "[wasm2c][19]".  
`•` Solution C or #3 : "[gomoku][20]", "[Cfront][21]" or "[Comeau C&#47;C&#43;&#43;][22]".  
`•` Solution D or #4 : "[go2c][23]".  
`•` ...  
<br />
<br />
WHICH&#160; `Go`-To-`C` SOLUTION&#160; (out of above solutions) IS BETTER <b>?</b>  
( better at keeping high-level algorithms/structures,etc fairly or accurately same in output source-code )  
is there (similar) better transpiler solution, among the links that i have shown ?  
Above (transpiler-set) solutions have what Pros/Cons ?  
<br />
<br />

<h3>SOLUTION&#160; ANALYSIS&#160; &amp;&#160; PROs/CONs&#160; &amp;&#160; PROBLEM(s):</h3>

<h4>SOLUTION A or &#35;1&#8239;:</h4>
Solution-Set A or &#35;1&#8239;:
<ul><li> steps: we are attempting to do these:<br />
<code>"Go"</code>--&gt;<code>"C#"</code>--&gt;<code>"Lua"</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code>
  <ul><li> (<b>A</b>-1) use this 
  "<a href="https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs">go2cs</a>" 
  transpiler to convert <code>"Go"</code>/<code>"Golang"</code> source-code 
  into <code>"C#"</code> (C-sharp) based code.
    <ul><li> (place your GoProject here: <code>D:\Dev\GoProject\</code>)<br />
    (create & go inside this folder: <code>D:\Dev\Go-to-CS-GoProject\</code>)<br />
    Convert a single <code>Go</code> file: <code>go2cs -l D:\\Dev\\GoProject\\src\\Main.go</code><br />
    Convert entire <code>Go</code> project: <code>go2cs D:\\Dev\\GoProject</code><br />
    Convert <code>Go</code> Standard Library: <code>go2cs -s -r D:\\Dev\\GoProject\\src\\</code>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> (<b>A</b>-2) convert that <code>"C#"</code> source-code into 
  <code>"Lua"</code> code with this 
  "<a href="https://github.com/yanghuan/CSharp.lua">CSharp.lua</a>" transpiler.
    <ul><li> <tt>D:&#92;&gt; dotnet CSharp.Lua.Launcher.dll -h </tt><br />
<pre><code>Usage: CSharp.lua [-s srcfolder] [-d dstfolder]
Arguments
-s : can be a directory where all cs files will be compiled, or a list of files, using ';' or ',' to separate
-d : destination directory, will put the out lua files
Options
-h : show the help message and exit
...</code></pre>(source 
    folder should be: <code>D:\Dev\Go-to-CS-GoProject\</code>)<br />
    (create & specify destination folder: <code>D:\Dev\CS-to-Lua-GoProject\</code>)
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> (<b>A</b>-3) convert that <code>"Lua"</code> source-code into 
  <code>"C"</code> code with this "<a href="https://github.com/davidm/lua2c">lua2c</a>" 
  transpiler.
    <ul><li> (create & go into a folder 1st like this: <code>D:\Dev\Lua-to-C-GoProject\</code> 
    or specify previous as destination folder in next command)<br />
    <code>lua</code> to <code>C</code> cmd: <code>lua lua2c.lua D:\Dev\CS-to-Lua-GoProject\Main.lua</code>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> in this solution-"A", a developer have to be familiar with <code>"C#"</code> & 
<code>"Lua"</code>, and you can also clearly see that transpile/conversion occurred 3-TIMES : 
<code>"Go"</code>--&gt;<code>"C#"</code>--&gt;<code>"Lua"</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code>, 
which is not-very-good . Conversion done by <code>go2cs</code> is high-quality(<b>HQ</b>), 
but other tools in chain are not that much HQ, so overall conversion quality is not good.<br />
As dev/user also need to know middle language(s), ( and i'm not very familiar with 
<code>C#</code> or <code>Lua</code> ).<br />
In solution-"A", atleast final destination <code>"C"</code> code will still 
have high-level structures fairly intact that were used in initial 
<code>"Go"</code> source-code.
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h4>SOLUTION B or &#35;2&#8239;:</h4>
Solution-Set B or &#35;2&#8239;:
<ul><li> steps: in this solution we attempt to do these:<br />
<code>"Go"</code>--&gt;<code>"C#"</code>--&gt;<code>"WebAssembly"</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code>. 
(also see alternative Solution-E)
  <ul><li> (<b>B</b>-1) use this "<a href="https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/go2cs">go2cs</a>" 
  transpiler to convert <code>"Go"</code>/<code>"Golang"</code> source-code 
  into <code>"C#"</code> (C-sharp) based code.
    <ul><li> see sub-section inside above Solution-A-1.
    </li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> (<b>B</b>-2) convert that <code>"C#"</code> source-code into 
  <code>"WebAssembly"</code> code with this 
  "<a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/Components">Blazor</a>" 
  transpiler.</li>
  <li> (<b>B</b>-3) convert that <code>"WebAssembly"</code> source-code into 
  <code>"C"</code> code with this 
  "<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a>" 
  transpiler.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> in this solution-"B" also doing conversion 3-TIMES : 
<code>"Go"</code>--&gt;<code>"C#"</code>--&gt;<code>"WebAssembly"</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code>, 
but these steps will completely breakdown all high-level structures & meaningful 
programming codes into large amount of micro (machine level) elements, etc,<br />
Thus its depriving me or developer from chance to improve 
source-code further or improve quickly.<br />
( btw, in my case, i'm familiar with <code>"Assembly"</code> & <code>"C"</code> & 
also <code>"C++"</code> ).
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h4>SOLUTION C or &#35;3&#8239;:</h4>
Solution-Set C or &#35;3&#8239;:
<ul><li> (<b>C</b>-1) use this "<a href="https://github.com/lpereira/gomoku">gomoku</a>" 
transpiler to convert <code>"Go"</code>/<code>"Golang"</code> source-code into 
<code>"C++"</code> based code.
  <ul><li>(<b>C</b>-2) convert that <code>"C++"</code> source-code into <code>"C"</code> 
  code with (any one of these) transpilers like these: 
  <a href="http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/c_plus_plus">Cfront</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.comeaucomputing.com/">Comeau C&#47;C&#43;&#43;</a>, 
  also see these SO(StackOverflow) pages for more info: 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/737257/">1</a>, 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15970804/">2</a>, 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1833484/">3</a>, 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5050349/">4</a>.<br />
  Compiler tools can also convert <code>C++</code>-to-<code>C</code><sup><a href="https://github.com/JuliaComputing/llvm-cbe">1</a></sup>:<br />
  &#160;&#160;<code>clang -c CPPtoC.cpp -o CPPtoC.bc -emit-llvm</code><br />
  &#160;&#160;<code>clang -march=c CPPtoC.bc -o CPPtoC.c</code><br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;or<br />
  &#160;&#160;<code>llvm-g++ -c CPPtoC.cpp -o CPPtoC.bc -emit-llvm</code><br />
  &#160;&#160;<code>llc -march=c -enable-correct-eh-support CPPtoC.bc -o CPPtoC.c</code>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> in this solution-"C" steps , transpile/conversion occurred 2-TIMES : 
<code>"Go"</code>--&gt;<code>"C++"</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code> . In "Go"-to-"C++" conversion by "gomoku", only subset (smaller portion) of "Go" is supported, but it can keep high-level structures/algorithms, etc intact . Then, in "C++"-to-"C" conversion stage, output quality varies . When LLVM/llc, etc are used, then output "C" does not have input's high-level structures intact anymore . Comeau C&#47;C&#43;&#43; appears able to keep high-level structures intact during "C++"-to-"C" conversion, but it is a proprietary (aka: not-openSource) & older tool.
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h4>SOLUTION D or &#35;4&#8239;:</h4>
<ul><li> (<b>D</b>-1) use this "<a href="https://github.com/mukadr/go2c">go2c</a>"(mukadr) 
transpiler to convert <code>"Go"</code> source-code into <code>"C"</code> 
based code, though it can transpile <code>"Go"</code>-to-<code>"C"</code> 
by itself, but at this moment (when this was posted here), 
sadly this supports only a subset components of Go.  
These transpilers can also be used for <code>Go-to-C</code> conversion : 
<a href="https://github.com/gopherc/goc">goc</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/mewbak/go-transpiler">go-transpiler</a>(mewbak), 
etc, but these also only supports subset of <code>"Go"</code> language, 
at this moment (when this was posted here).
</li>
<li> in this solution-"D", transpiler can convert 'Go' into 'C' directly 
in one-time w/o using any other intermediate transpilers : 
<code>Go</code>--&gt;<code>"C"</code> , but does not support conversion 
of all components of <code>Go</code>-language.
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h3>EXTRA - SOLUTIONS&#8239;:</h3>

<h4>SOLUTION E or &#35;5&#8239;:</h4>
Solution-Set E or &#35;5&#8239;:
<ul><li> steps: this Solution-E is alternative of above Solution-B.
  <ul><li> (<b>E</b>-1) use these commands to convert <code>"Go"</code> into 
  <code>"Go"-"Assembly"</code>, <code>"go2goasm"</code>, output of 
  <code>"Go"</code>-tool is a Google/Golang flavored <code>"Assembly"</code>, 
  its not completely Standard/regular <code>Assembly</code>, but close to it .

  source-code file, and manually change/convert incompatible portions into general 
  <code>Assembly</code> until Boomerang can do Asm-to-C conversion . Or use

will not-include any high-level structures of "Go" source, new high-level 
<code>C</code> will be something different, though functioning same way.<br />
Usually this solution is faster.

<h4>OTHER&#8239;:</h4>
This "<a href="https://github.com/andygeiss/esp32-transpiler">esp32-transpiler</a>" can convert 'Go' into 'C' for Arduino (an embedded system), but only small subset of 'Go' lang spec is supported.

<h3>CONCLUSION OF "Go"-To-"C" SOLUTIONS&#8239;:</h3>
<ul><li> at this point:<br />
  So, solution-"A" (go2cs-&gt;CSharp.lua-&gt;lu2c) is better than solution-"B" (go2cs-&gt;Blazor-&gt;wasm2c).<br />
  solution-"E" (go2asm-&gt;asm2c) is obviously better than solution-"B" (go2cs-&gt;Blazor-&gt;wasm2c).<br />
  solution-"F" (go2cs-&gt;hurley) is better than solution-"A" (go2cs-&gt;CSharp.lua-&gt;lu2c).<br />
  solution-"C" (gomoku-&gt;cfront) is better than solution-"A" (go2cs-&gt;CSharp.lua-&gt;lu2c).<br />
  solution-"F" (go2cs-&gt;hurley) is better than solution-"C" (gomoku-&gtcfront;).<br />
  solution-"C" (gomoku-&gt;cfront) is better than solution-"D" (go2c/goc/go-transpiler).<br />
  So, solution-"F" (go2cs-&gt;hurley) is best <code>"Go"</code>-to-<code>"C"</code> transpiler-set,<br />
  at this point, among previous choices (when this message was posted here 2020-Oct-22).<br />

# SOLUTIONS&#160; FOR&#160; 'Go'-TO-'C++'&#8239;:
Many developers have pointed out, in some cases `C++` (based compiled program) can often be much better & faster than `C` ones, so i'm also displaying these few options in below to convert/transpile `Go` source-code directly (or via multiple stages) into `C++` source-code while keeping higher-level algorithms & structures fairly intact/accurate as much as possible , in this way output `C++` source-code is also easier to improve as/when necessary:
* SOLUTION CHOICES&#8239;:
  * ALT-SOLUTION A or &#35;1<b>:</b> use [gomoku][20] for `Go` to `C++`.
  * ALT-SOLUTION B or &#35;2<b>:</b> use [go2cpp][24] for `Go` to `C++20`/`C++17`.
  * ALT-SOLUTION C or &#35;3<b>:</b> use [GoLite Transpiler][25] for `GoLite` (subset of `Go`) to `C++` . GoLite Transp supports only subset of `Go`.
  * ALT-SOLUTION D or &#35;4<b>:</b> use [go2cs][15] for `Go` to `C#`(C-Sharp), then use any of these: [cs2cpp][26], [Alter-Native][27], [CoreRT][28], [OneLang][29], [Ranger][30], etc to convert `C#` into `C++`.
  * ALT-SOLUTION E or &#35;5<b>:</b> use [go-transpiler][31](Theodus) for `Go` to `C++`.
* WHICH&#160; `Go`-To-`C++` SOLUTION&#160; (out of above solutions) IS BETTER <b>?</b>  
  ( better at keeping high-level algorithms/structures,etc fairly or accurately same in output source-code )
* CONCLUSION ON `"Go"`-TO-`"C++"`<b>:</b>  
  Alt-Solution-A (gomoku) is obviously slightly better than Alt-Solution-B (go2cpp),  
  and Alt-Solution-B (go2cpp) is much better than Alt-Solution-C (GoLite Transp),  
  and Alt-Solution-D (go2cs+cs2cpp) is also much better than Alt-Solution-C (GoLite Transp).  
  In Alt-Soln-D, though `go2cs` conversion quality is higher, but next stage `cs2cpp` tools are not.  
  and Alt-Solution-D (go2cs+cs2cpp) is better than Alt-Solution-B (go2cpp).  
  So Alt-Solution-A (gomoku) is best at this point, among these available transpiler choices, (when this message was posted here).

# OTHER&#160; INFORMATION&#160; &&#160; REFERENCES&#8239;:
I have added reference-links immediately after each sentence or section bu using superscript numbers.  

**Go2C** Conversion : My objective is here is to share simple steps/directions on converting / TRANSPILING `Go`-language source-code into `C` (or `C++`) lnaguage source-code , with one of the mentioned (in above) possible set of TRANSPILER-set solutions , that can still keep high-level algorithms / structures, etc used in initial/input `Go` source-code , fairly or accurately same/intact in final destination / output `C` (or `C++`) source-code.  

Then we can compile such transpiled/transcompiled `C/C++` source-code (into binary machine code) when necessary, to run it faster.  

So after `Go-to-C` or `Go-to-C++` source-code conversion , it will be possible to change source-code , to add required necessary feature or functionality , and improve `C` (or `C++`) source-code.  

Some users have mis-conception (aka: brainwashed) about `"Go"` computer programming language , and some users intentionally lies purposefully as they work under some projects from "Google" or projects supported by "Google", or working under a project that uses Google products, for-example : Google's "Go" language, Google Advertisements, Violating Privacy-Rights (aka Spying on People,Citizens,Users,Persons), etc, etc , these are hard-core Google-PUSHERS/supporters , some of these criminal/"evil" acts are very dangerous Anti-Humanity (Anti-Human-Rights) activities.  

We need to push Google (and it's parent company: Alphabet) and it's corporate-controllers by exposing their criminal & "evil" activities , so that their harmful & "evil" acts are Questioned & punished , so that in end Google (and Alphabet) & it's corp-controllers chooses real good & correct & non-"evil" ways to do good & correct & non-"evil" things for People, Citizens, Users , not-only inside USA but for entire World.  
In entire world, country after country are now filing Lawsuit against years of Google's "evil"/hamrful practices . So if Google/Alphabet wants to do business with/for people/companies, they need to cultivate good & non-"evil" practices.<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_litigation), [3](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52887340), [4](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit-idUSKBN23933H), [5](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/technology/google-antitrust-justice-department.html), [6](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/department-of-justice-state-attorneys-general-to-sue-google-for-antitrust-violations-report/)</sup>

# DETERMINE&#8239; BETTER&#8239; TRANSPILER&#8239;:

How To Determine Which Transpiler/Tarnscompiler Is Better Than Another <b>?</b>

CHECK+COMPARE&#8239; SUPPORTED&#8239; COMMANDS&#8239;/&#8239;INSTRUCTIONS, FUNCTIONS, etc&#8239; <b>LIST</b>&#8239; PROVIDED&#8239; BY&#8239; TRANSPILER&#8239; DEVELOPER&#8239;/&#8239;WEBSITE&#8239;<b>:</b>  
Transpiler software's primary-dev or project's website displays LIST of supported commands/instructions, functions, etc language components . Their primary developer(s) & other developers are developing+improving those transpiler-projects when they can . Usually support for more options, instructions, etc are added into these Transpiler projects.  
So, you have to often <b>check</b> out those <b>LIST</b>s & <b>COMPARE</b>, to find out which transpiler is better.  
And also do this TEST : use same source file and convert with multiple transpilers (in sae category) , and check & compare output source-code file , to find out which transpiler able to do conversion completely or which one has skipped some portions or which one has done incorrect conversion.  
So, Which one is BEST, that will always change or most-likely be different at different time.  
(and "BEST" is connected with different "Category" , so based on different category there are different types of BEST, and at different time)
<br />
<br />
<br />

# PRE&#8239; &&#8239; POST&#8239; STEPS&#8239; OF&#8239; TRANSPILATION&#8239;:
Most of the time, certain code/strings need to be modified/changed, & prepared in each initial source-code (here `"Go"`) files (with [PreProcessor][66] type of software), before the primary transpiler can be used.  
And, often you also have to change some specific style of code/string in each output (here `"C"` or `"C++"`) file , and you also have to fix or change something that was not automatically generated by transpiler in output source-code.  
So use below code/string replacing script-codes, mentioned in below linked SO/SE pages:
* These SO(StackOverflow)/&#8239;SE(StackExchange) Q+A(s) are showing various solutions:

# SOURCE&#8239; TRANSPILING&#8239; &&#8239; SOFTWARE&#8239; DEVELOPMENT&#8239; (BASIC)&#8239;:
Some users have tendency to give false & wrong suggestions and wrong advice(s) and wrong Answer (about Transpiler , Transpilation, etc) . If quesiton is about "A", then such user(s) answer for "B" & says they answered the Quesion about "A" ... this is wrong + incorrect , even if the answer for "B" is a very good solution , because its not an answer for Quesiton-"A" . Answer for Quesiton-"A" must discuss about "A" & provide solution for "A" , then that user can/may talk about "B" inside an extra-info section in bottom-side of an answer.

So here in below, i have tried to gather & post correct advices , after reading & contacting more knowledgeable persons & their discussions<b>:</b>
* There are some USE CASES where using `C/C++` is better, if that is the case for your software need or your project's target/objectives, then TRANSPILE `Go`/`✱` into `C/C++` with transpiler, Or transpile manually by hand-typing in `C`/`C++` code, by replacing `Go`/`✱` (with equivalent `C`/`C++` code) . Which steps you will take, that freedom & choice is yours.
  * And there are also some USE CASES where using `Go` is better, if that is the case for your software need or project's target, then you should avoid conversion/transpilation of `Go` into something else, instead improve existing `Go` codebase, if you can after learning it . And again, which steps you will take, that freedom & choice is yours.
  * So, transpile into `C`/`C++`, when features & specialties & benefits of `C`/`C++` usage are needed, And know firsthand/early, where (aka: in which USE CASES) `C`/`C++` excels and where `Go` excels, then decide to do+follow correct & balanced steps.
    * Use multiple search-engine websites to find-out <b>:</b> "<i>When to use Go/Golang</i>", "<i>When to not use Go/Golang</i>", "<i>When to use `C/C++`</i>", "<i>When to not use `C/C++`</i>", or use only `C` or `C++` or `Go` or `Golang`, etc.
* Anyone can transpile/translate/transform any source-code for personal use or for test purpose, etc, etc . Information related activities are fundamental human rights <sup>[1][48], [2][49], [3][50], [4][51], [5][52]</sup> . Everyone has fundamental Rights to transpile/translate/transform any lang/code into any native/other lang code, for-example: to defend ourselve from harmful instructions, conversations, lies, etc.
* For example, If you don't understand a Book written in French, then learning French would be "good" but it will for sure take you many many months or years to actually understand many facets & layers of French in order to accumulate related layers of required understanding/knowledge on French, but "better" is to have the content (that Book) TRANSLATED by expert language-translators into your own NATIVE LANGUAGE OR simply find the translated version of that Book (many Book publishers publish translated editions when its popular), then you will actually understand it (that Book's translation) much much better . Normally human cannot learn ALL about French within even 6months<b>.</b>
* If you want to add a very specific feature in a (specific) software, later we will call it "upstream" software, which that software's dev has denied to add, then ask again & this time propose to sponsor/pay to add that feature if you have (monetary) resource.  
• But when that is not possible, you can try to add that feature by yourself in a "fork" of that software . Specify publicly in your fork, what exactly you're trying to do in your fork . You may even find more users contributing in your fork to develop/improve that feature, to ultimately include improvements in that upstream software.  
• But, if you do not understand the language used in that (upstream) software very well, then one option is to learn it, & try to understand related sections , so "fork" that (upstream) software, & try to add new feature in that forked software . You can add copyright notice on your contributed code & on your code-files contribution, but usually you have to release it with same license type that is used by the "upstream" project, not with a different or incompatible license.<sup><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/330733/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#Expat">3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing#Cases">4</a></sup>  
Disclaimer: IANAL.  
• If above steps are not working well or not-suitable enough to achieve your goal/objectives , then, one of the option you have is: "Transpile" the entire (upstream) software into the "destination" computer language which is your native computer language which you have LEARNED & understand better . By the way, this is not an easy option.  
• So begin with by creating a new project in GitHub<sup>[1][76]</sup>, BitBucket<sup>[1][77]</sup>, GNU-Savannah<sup>[1][78]</sup>, SourceForge<sup>[1][79]</sup>, GitLab<sup>[1][80]</sup>, etc etc various open-source code collaboration repository sites<sup>[1][81]</sup> (aka: <b>SCH</b>=Source-Code-Hosting), choose such site where more devs with higher-skill on that "destination" computer language are hanging-out, and posses friendly collaborative spirit . Or, create project in multiple code-collaboration sites & SYNC each one after each code-update . Or, load Git<sup>[1][82], [2][83], [3][84]</sup> <b>VCS</b> (version control software<sup>[1][85]</sup>) in your own server or personal computer, & put your transpiled code in it. (Repo=Repository)  
• Transpile a specific version of upstream software inside your own computer, then immediately upload output source-code of transpilation, into your SCH or VCS, either publish it publicly if you want to share it , Or create "private"-type repo (without publishing it publicly) . If you're skilled enough to develop all side by yourself, then "private"-type repo is useful, Or, keep it "private" until you completely convert all remaining `Go` into `C/C++` . After complete "Go-to-C" or "Go-to-C++" conversion, If you publish publicly then other devs/users can see & may join to improve it or contribute in it.  
• In source-code conversion/transformation steps, if input source-code is `GPL` licensed, then output also have to be licensed under `GPL` (in most cases. CWPL) . And without all copyright-holder(s) & code-contributor's permission/approval, the `GPL` license (generally) cannot be changed into another license . When input source-code is licensed under `Apache`, `BSD`, `MIT`, etc (or code was released in Public Domain) then output can have same Or different license . If you use or have used your own hand, eye, brain to transform/transpile (aka: source-to-source code conversion) manually some portions or significant portions of source-code , then you can claim copyright ONLY on the portions of code which you yourself have manually by yourself modified or transformed or written (without using any machine/software based transpilation) , so in such case you can add your name under the input/"upstream" software's copyright-holder(s) name, in the destination language (here `"C/C++"`) source-code .  If you have used machine or mechanized process or software to do complete code transpilation, then you cannot claim any copyright on any portion which were transpiled in such way (because, a machine has done it, not you), and in such case, input/"upstream" software's copyright-holder(s) name(s) must be added/declared back into the destination/output source-code, (and again, you cannot add your name under those "upstream"/input software's copyright-holders).<sup>[1][86]</sup>&#160;  So far, there is no Transpiler software, that can do complete 100% conversion of large or real-life useful practical projects , human conversion/transpilation is always needed .  Usually If you have seen (input) source-code or source-algorithms, and then if you have written / transformed / transpiled those algorithms with your own hand, eye, brain, etc manually by yourself into a DIFFERENT destination/output language based code, here `C/C++`, only then, it is a totally new work done/created by you .  When you need to transpile propietory functions done by a machine-code binary program(s) then you first have to find another developer-user who will first convert machine-code or proprietory source-code or dissassembed `Assembly` source-code, etc into "Algorithms", flow-chart, etc, etc first , then you can only see that "Algorithms",etc, (you cannot & must-not see see any source-codes), and then you can write new source-codes (in same or different computer programming language) with your own (human) hand , then such will be treated as "new work", otherwise it will be treated as a "derivative work") . So, in such "new work" case, you can add your name as copyright-holder, without adding any input / "upstream" software's previous copyright-holder(s) name(s) , & you can also use whichever license you prefer, in the output source-code.  
  Disclaimer: IANAL. CWPL.  
• Usually, in a transpiled output/destination code , many many code-portions have to be re-worked/re-written by human, to functionally perform same-way as "upstream" (aka: input source-code) software , especially those portions, which you initially could-not transpile during manual transpilation/transformation process, and, there will also be many many non-transpiled source-code portions, when you have used mechanized (or automated) transpilation process or transpiler software , as these tools are not yet capable to transpile (all type of codes) completely, and instead transpiles only a subset(smaller portion) of (simple or limited-advanced) input source-code language into destination/output language . So you or a HUMAN have to write, fix, adjust, & adapt ("destination" language) source-code, and compile / run / test / improve it.  
• Once you have achieved the state, where, your (transpiled and then improved output/destination code based) software can run same-way as upstream software , then, you can start adding your feature or functionality that you need or want to add . If you have publshed source-code publicly then, you may also find that other devs have began to join & contribute in this new project.  
• In any OPEN-SOURCE project, one of the most helpful thing to bring in more code contributors is : Addition of DETAIL COMMENTS & NOTES on each code line & section, and describe what a code-line/code-section is actually doing . So create a ToDo for yourself & for any code-contributors, that, beside improving code directly, this new project also need contribution of more detail COMMENTS & NOTES ON CODE . So that some devs can spend time on understanding + identifying each line & section & algorithm, and start adding detail general human-friendly notes & comments . <b>Do not make comment & note helpful only for advanced devs , as that creates islands & separation & division . That is opposite of open-source spirit . Everyone, even general user, should be able to understand a code line/section, after reading comments & notes.</b>  
• If upstream software's dev also transpiles new feature or functionality that you & your team has added , or you have transpiled again from "C-to-Go" , and add into forked project of "upstream" , then upstream dev can also add new feat/functionality into the upstream software.  
• When everyone is open-sourcing their work, means SHARING IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHERS , then everyone is benefitted more . Each of us, We all have learned something from another person who has shared something old or shared something that he has improved , SO IN THAT SAME WAY , we all need to share old & share improved works with others.
